What kind of feeling I don't understand...

It's just the way we're all silent...

In fact, I don't have too much commitment.

As long as you can say love me...

Hide his tenderness in your sky.

My tears have never stopped...

I can give you endless waiting...

Instead of thawing some of your apathy

Oh - the story of love is to me...

Just like a blank waiting for...

Oh - --

The love story is to me...

It's like a dream that doesn't start...

What kind of feeling I don't understand...

It's just the way we're all silent...

In fact, I don't have too much commitment.

As long as you can say, love me...

Hide his tenderness in your sky.

My tears have never stopped...

I can give you endless waiting...

Instead of thawing some of your apathy...

Oh - the story of love is to me...

Just like a blank waiting for...

Oh - --

Love stories for me...

It's like a dream that doesn't start...

What kind of feeling I don't understand...

It's just the way we're all silent...

In fact, I don't have too much commitment...

As long as you can say love me...

In fact, I don't have too much commitment...

As long as you can say, love me
